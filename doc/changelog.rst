.. rubric:: Development version

* Many improvements to the our PSO support.
  This includes better logging of detailed constraint evaluation information,
  improved stability in a few corner cases,
  and offline evaluation of previous shark runs.
* Improved the memory footprint of |s| executions.
  We have made a major overhaul of the code
  to be more memory efficient,
  thus allowing for better resource usage,
  specially in HPC systems
  and PSO executions.
  Several experiments with our mini-SURFS and medi-SURFS datasets
  show a decrease of about 20% on peak memory usage.

.. rubric:: 1.2.1

* Fixed compilation problem related to OpenMP support.

.. rubric:: 1.2.0

* Initial version of the :doc:`PSO optimization routines <optim>`,
  originally contributed by Mawson Sammons.
  This initial version allows users to run PSO over |s|
  using an arbitrary number of parameters.
  Two evaluation functions (chi2 and log student-t)
  and three constraints with flexible domains (SMF at z=0,1 and HIMF at z=0)
  can be chosen from.
  Execution in both desktop/laptop and HPC environments is supported.
* |s| can also read halo inputs from hydro-dynamical simulations.
* Correctly tracking history of subhalos across snapshots.
* Simple model of radiation pressure QSO feedback included.
* Extended outputs including halo properties.
* Add optional execution parameter to seed random number engines,
  and recording it on output files.
  These two options allow users to fully reproduce a previous |s| run.
  For now this works for single-threaded executions only.
* Improved support for the MSVC compiler.
  |s| now correctly compiles, runs, and standard plots work correctly on Windows.
* Improved the |ss| script to accept additional environment variables
  to set default values for submission parameters.
* Miscelaneous additions and modifications to plotting scripts.

.. rubric:: 1.1.0

* Fixed bug in spin parameter of halos
  as it was randomly chosen despite the value
  the progenitor halo had.
  Now this is coherently propagated through the halo history.
* Type-2 velocity dispersions now consider
  virial theorem at the radius at which the galaxy lives.
* Added new concentration model of Dutton14
* |s| successfully building on Windows with Visual Studio compiler.
* Explicitly supporting OpenMP >= 2.0;
  before we were implicitly requiring >= 3.0.
* Fixed some small problems with |ss|
* Plot scripts simplified to use the redshift table
  to correctly calculate the snapshots they should read

.. rubric:: 1.0.0

* First public release of shark
