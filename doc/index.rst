|s| is a new, flexible semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

Thanks to its flexibility,
|s| allows for easy exploration of different physical processes.
Shark has been implemented
with several models for gas cooling,
active galactic nuclei,
stellar and photo-ionization feedback,
and star formation (SF).
The software can determine
the stellar mass function and stellar–halo mass relation at z=0–4;
cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density,
stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen;
local gas scaling relations;
and structural galaxy properties.
It performs particularly well
for the mass–size relation for discs/bulges,
the gas–stellar mass and stellar mass–metallicity relations.

|s| is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP.
It currently compiles with all major compilers
(gcc, clang, MSVC), but any C++11-enabled compiler should work.
It comes with a set of standard plotting scripts and HPC-related utilities
to ease its usage across as many platforms as possible.
