``bulges_diskins``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``metallicity_histories``: Stellar metallicity of the stars formed in a timestep that by this output time ends up in the bulge formed via disk instabilities
* ``star_formation_rate_histories``: Star formation history of stars formed that by this output time end up in the bulge formed via disk instabilities [Msun/yr/h]


``bulges_mergers``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``metallicity_histories``: Stellar metallicity of the stars formed in a timestep that by this output time ends up in the bulge formed via galaxy mergers
* ``star_formation_rate_histories``: Star formation history of stars formed that by this output time end up in the bulge formed via galaxy mergers [Msun/yr/h]


``cosmology``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``h``: normalization of hubble parameter H0 = h * 100 (km/s)/Mpc
* ``n_s``: scalar spectral index assumed in simulation
* ``omega_b``: omega baryon assumed in simulation
* ``omega_l``: omega lambda assumed in simulation
* ``omega_m``: omega matter assumed in simulation
* ``sigma8``: fluctuation amplitude at 8 Mpc/h
* ``delta_t``: Time interval covered between snapshots [Gyr]


``disks``
^^^^^^^^^
* ``metallicity_histories``: Stellar metallicity of the stars formed in a timestep that by this output time ends up in the disk
* ``star_formation_rate_histories``: Star formation history of stars formed that by this output time end up in the disk [Msun/yr/h]


``galaxies``
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``id_galaxy``: galaxy ID. Unique to this galaxy throughout time. If this galaxy never mergers onto a central, then its ID is always the same.
* ``lbt_mean``: Look back time to mean time between snapshots [Gyr]
* ``redshifts``: Redshifts of the history outputs


``run_info``
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* ``batches``: number of batches analysed
* ``effective_volume``: effective volume of this run [(cMpc/h)^3]
* ``lbox``: Box side size of the full simulated volume [Mpc/h]
* ``ode_solver_precision``: accuracy applied when solving the ODE system of the physical model.
* ``particle_mass``: dark matter particle mass of this simulation [Msun/h]
* ``redshift``: output redshift
* ``seed``: The seed value used in the random number engines
* ``shark_git_has_local_changes``: whether this shark instance had uncommitted local changes
* ``shark_git_revision``: the git revision of shark used to produce this data
* ``shark_version``: the shark version
* ``skip_missing_descendants``: boolean parameter that sets whether the code ignores subhalos that have no descendants.
* ``snapshot``: output snapshot
* ``timestamp``: time at which this shark execution started
* ``tot_n_subvolumes``: Total number of subvolumes in which the simulated box was divided into
